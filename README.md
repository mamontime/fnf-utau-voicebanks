ash, bluskys, jghost, and minishoey are from bob and bosip in the background week by amoraltra and the bob and bosip team. amor voicebanks for EIOU samples are from his stream videos.

shaggy rogers is from the shaggy mod by srperez

cablecrow is from zardy mod bushwack update by swankybox, rozebud, kadedev, starnyart, sugarratio, turvie, charriii5, and jads (the last one provided cablecrow's voice)

everyone else is from the friday night defending mod (ace attorney mod reskin) by certified weirdo/weirdocertified/itwasonekiss. i was allowed permission to make mod reskins inspired by their mod and to use her sprites for them so im adding voicebanks to the characters.
